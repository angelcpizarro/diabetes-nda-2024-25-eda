# 🩺 National Diabetes Audit (2024–25) – Type 2 Diabetes Analysis  

This project analyses data from the **National Diabetes Audit (NDA) 2024–25** to explore the quality of diabetes care across England. Focusing on patients with Type 2 diabetes, it examines prevalence, delivery of care processes, achievement of treatment targets, regional variation, and potential inequalities by age, sex, and ethnicity.   

The project demonstrates skills in **Python-based data analysis**, including cleaning real-world healthcare datasets, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and deriving actionable insights relevant to healthcare analytics.

## 🎯 Objectives  

- Clean and structure the NDA dataset (Type 2 and other registrations, care processes, and treatment targets).  
- Explore prevalence of Type 2 diabetes nationally and across Integrated Care Boards (ICBs).  
- Analyse delivery of the 8 NICE-recommended care processes and identify variation.  
- Assess achievement of 3 NICE treatment targets (HbA1c, blood pressure, statins).  
- Compare care process vs. treatment target performance across ICBs.  
- Explore equity in outcomes across age, sex, and ethnicity groups.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries  

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebooks  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib/Seaborn 
- SQLite (via Python)

## 📊 Key Insights  

- **Prevalence:** Type 2 diabetes prevalence varies widely across ICBs, with some managing substantially larger patient populations.  
- **Care Processes:** Delivery of all 8 care processes ranges from above 70% in the best-performing ICBs to just over 30% in the lowest.  
- **Treatment Targets:** HbA1c control is the hardest target to meet, with only 65% of patients reaching it, compared with 83% for blood pressure and 78% for statins. Only ~45% of patients achieve all 3 simultaneously.  
- **Regional Variation:** There is a consistent gap between the best- and worst-performing ICBs, suggesting systematic differences in service delivery.  
- **Equity:** Differences are mainly in **who has diabetes** (prevalence by age, sex, ethnicity) rather than in **care quality once diagnosed**. Outcomes are broadly similar across groups, though younger adults and minority groups remain important to monitor.

## 🚀 Next Steps  

I plan to extend this project by building an **interactive dashboard** (e.g., in Power BI or Tableau) to visualise prevalence, care processes, treatment targets, and equity more dynamically. This would demonstrate how insights from the analysis can be delivered to stakeholders in a practical, user-friendly format.
